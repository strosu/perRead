BACKEND:

- support for user management:
    - create new user
    - authenticate as user
    - restrict access; play with roles, i.e. don't allow any user to craete new articles
    - add reading tokens to the current user (requires signing in)

- figure out potential controllers: 
    - add reading tokens (under Account)
    - unlock article (under Article?)
    - get Article (under Article)
    - show unlocked articles; for privacy reasons, maybe don't store the list? need an alrorithm that would hash and see if an article is already unlocked (similar to password checking)
    - Authors controller; need some form of readMe for Authors

- revisit tags, safety around parallel requests

- do some basic search for titles
    - do more advanced search for article contents? grep maybe?

FRONTEND:
